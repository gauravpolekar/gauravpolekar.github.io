            Hello world, I am Gaurav, working with Amazon as software development engineer 2,
            As a software engineer with 9 years of experience, 
             I have had the opportunity to work with some fantastic companies 
             (Persistent Systems, eQ Technologic, Acquia and Amazon) 
             and talented
              individuals.
                 

                Working with these companies and people has not only helped me grow as a 
                software engineer but has also taught me the importance of collaboration, 
                communication, and continuous learning. 
                I am grateful for these experiences and look forward to what the future holds.

              When I'm not working, you can find me on the cricket field, enjoying my favorite hobby Cricket.
