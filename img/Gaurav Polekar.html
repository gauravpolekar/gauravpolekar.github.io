            As a software engineer with 9 years of experience, 
             I have had the opportunity to work with some fantastic companies and talented
              individuals. My journey began at Persistent Systems,
               where I learned the fundamentals of software engineering and 
               gained valuable experience in the industry. 
               I then moved on to eQ Technologic,
                where I had the chance to work on some exciting projects and develop my 
                skillset.
                After that, I joined Acquia, where I worked with a highly skilled team to 
                build and maintain complex web application.
                 And currently, I am proud to be a part of the talented team at Amazon, 
                 where I am constantly challenged to think outside the box and push myself
                  to new limits.

                Working with these companies and people has not only helped me grow as a 
                software engineer but has also taught me the importance of collaboration, 
                communication, and continuous learning. 
                I am grateful for these experiences and look forward to what the future holds.

              When I'm not working, you can find me on the cricket field, enjoying my favorite hobby Cricket
